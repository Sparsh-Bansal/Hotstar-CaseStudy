# Hotstar-CaseStudy
This is a real life case study related to a streaming video company say Hotstar/Netflix. The company launched a particular show, the problem is initially the TRP for that show was very good but suddenly the company notice the decline in the TRP for that particular show. They were interested to find out that what can be the possible reason due to which their show viewership has been decreased and what action they can take to fix that problem. This is a multiple regression model case and we have to build a perfect model to know what are the particular factors/columns which are impacting the viewership and to predict its views in the future.
